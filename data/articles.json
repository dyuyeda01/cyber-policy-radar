But the tables seem to have turned somewhat for \"Rey,\" the moniker chosen by the technical operator and public face of the hacker group: Earlier this week, Rey confirmed his real life identity and agreed to an interview after KrebsOnSecurity tracked him down and contacted his father.",

But security experts warn these TV boxes require intrusive software that forces the user's network to relay Internet traffic for others, traffic that is often tied to cybercrime activity such as advertising fraud and account takeovers.",

Sixteen months later, however, Mozilla is still promoting Onerep. This week, Mozilla announced their partnership with Onerep will officially end next month.",
